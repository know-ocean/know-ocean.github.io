**Not all heroes wear capes. Not all marine biologists wear SCUBA**

... but I do that too. This post is about *why*. Why start KnowOcean.org? As I look back on my career and all of the *ad hoc* mentoring and advice I have given over several decades, I realize 2 things:
  1. I was lucky to fall into all the wonderful experiences I had
  2. It sure would have been nice to have someone give me all of that advice

Now I checked online to see if any marine biology samaritans had already taken care of you, but what I found was mostly aspiring influencers or people who had landed *unicorn* jobs giving pep talks. 

Here's my pep talk: most of you likely won't become marine biologists. And that is spectacular! Don't get me wrong, I wish everyone could make a career out of this, but I truly believe that the path of striving to achieve this career is a lifelong enrichment by itself.

One of the things I have loved most about my career in marine biology is the diversity of experience it requires. I believe that this path involves almost every subject we all were forced to take in high school (thus addressing the adolescent complaint of taking a class that will never be used):
  - **Biology:** duh...
  - **English:** not just communicating research and writing papers, but reading/conducting literature reviews
  - **Math:** yep, hate to break it to you... all real marine biology involves math at some level
  - **History/Civics:** the most consistent marine biology jobs out there are state and federal, so understanding the funding sources and their governmental purposes can be important
  - **Physical Education:** most marine biology data collection is ridiculously labor intensive

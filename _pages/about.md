Not counting school, I began my career in marine biology in 1997 on Cape Cod assisting the Northeast Marine Mammal Stranding Network coordinator. Since then, I have experienced a smorgasboard of marine biology work including: zooplankton processing, cetacean crosbow biopsies, pinniped scat collection, marine mammal necropsies, crab tagging, trawl sampling, fish ageing, microscopy, spectroscopy, biological modeling, simulation and fishery management.
